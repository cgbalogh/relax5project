                  These actions will be executed when entering this state. 
                  Typically there will be only one entry, but there may be multiple 
                  entries as well. You may set conditions inside the transition which control if 
                  the action will be executed. There are no buttons; execution will be dependent 
                  on the previous state.

                  These actions will be offered to the FE user as buttons. Each entry
                  represents one button that might be visible or not - depending on conditions 
                  inside the transition. Usually these buttons control the project flow. Typically there
                  will be a set of buttons available for the FE users.
